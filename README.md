   - Write SQL scripts to create tables with appropriate columns, data types, and constraints.

3. **Execute Scripts:**
   - Run the SQL scripts to create the tables in your MySQL database.
   
## Performing CRUD Operations

1. Implement Data Access Layer:

2. In your NetBeans project, create a Data Access Layer (DAO) to interact with the MySQL database. Implement methods for CRUD operations.
Connect GUI to Database:

3. Integrate your GUI components with the data access layer. Ensure that data entered in the GUI is saved, updated, and retrieved from the MySQL database.

## Using Apache NetBeans IDE with Swing

Swing is a GUI toolkit for Java, providing a set of components for building graphical user interfaces. NetBeans IDE seamlessly integrates with Swing, allowing developers to design and develop Swing-based GUIs effortlessly.

1. **Swing Palette:** NetBeans IDE provides a Swing Palette that allows you to drag-and-drop Swing components onto your GUI form, simplifying the UI design process.

2. **Visual Design:** With the NetBeans GUI Builder, you can visually design your Swing GUI by arranging components and setting properties through a user-friendly interface.

3. **Event Handling:** NetBeans IDE simplifies event handling in Swing applications. You can easily attach event handlers to components and manage their behavior.

## Benefits of Swing in GUI Development

- **Platform Independence:** Swing components are written in Java and are platform-independent, ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems.
- **Rich Set of Components:** Swing offers a wide range of customizable and extensible components, allowing developers to create versatile and feature-rich GUIs.


## javaSwing Library

Java Swing is a set of GUI (Graphical User Interface) components for building desktop applications in Java. It provides a rich set of tools and components that allow developers to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.Here are some key functionalities of the Java 

Swing library:

* Components: Swing provides a comprehensive set of GUI components such as buttons, text fields, labels, panels, dialogs, and more. These components are used to create the various elements of a user interface.

* Lightweight Architecture: Swing is built on top of the Java Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) and is known for its lightweight nature. It doesn't rely on the native platform's GUI components, making Swing applications platform-independent.

* Customization: Developers can extensively customize the appearance and behavior of Swing components. This includes setting colors, fonts, and other visual properties, as well as handling events to define how components respond to user interactions.

* Layout Managers: Swing provides layout managers that help arrange components within a container in a consistent and flexible manner. Layout managers automatically adjust the position and size of components based on the size of the container.

* Event Handling: Swing supports event-driven programming. Developers can define event listeners to handle user actions such as button clicks, mouse events, and key presses. This allows for creating responsive and interactive applications.

* Double Buffering: Swing uses double buffering to reduce flickering in graphical updates. This technique involves drawing graphics off-screen before displaying them on the screen, providing a smoother visual experience.

* Concurrency Support: Swing components are not thread-safe by default, but Swing provides utilities for handling concurrency in GUI applications, such as the SwingWorker class for background tasks.

* Internationalization (I18N): Swing supports internationalization and localization, allowing developers to create applications that can be easily adapted to different languages and regions.

* Drag-and-Drop: Swing includes built-in support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier for users to interact with data in a graphical interface.

* Accessibility: Swing provides features to enhance accessibility for users with disabilities, such as support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

* Java Swing has been widely used for developing desktop applications, although in recent years, JavaFX has gained popularity as an alternative framework for building rich and modern user interfaces in Java.



## javaSwing components used in Student-Result-Management-System

* JFrame: JFrame is a class in the Java Swing library that represents a top-level container for creating and managing a windowed GUI application. It provides the outer frame or window that holds and organizes other Swing components.

* JPanel: JPanel is a Swing component in Java used to create lightweight, general-purpose containers that are often used to group other components together. It is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and is included in the javax.swing package.

* JButton: JButton is a class in the Java Swing library that represents a button component in a graphical user interface (GUI). It is part of the javax.swing package and is commonly used to create interactive buttons that trigger actions when clicked.

* JTextField: JTextField is a Swing component in Java that allows users to input single-line text in a graphical user interface (GUI). It is part of the javax.swing package and is commonly used for various input purposes, such as taking user names, passwords, or any other textual data.

* JTable: JTable is a Swing component in Java that provides a way to display and edit tabular data in a graphical user interface (GUI). It's a versatile and powerful component commonly used in applications ranging from simple data display to complex database applications. 

* JPasswordField: JPasswordField is a Swing component in Java that provides a text input field specifically designed for entering sensitive information like passwords. It is part of the javax.swing package and is an extension of JTextField. The primary purpose of JPasswordField is to obscure the characters entered, typically displaying them as dots or asterisks, to enhance security.


## ActionListener interface

ActionListener is an interface in Java used for handling action events, which are generated by components such as buttons, menu items, and other interactive elements in a graphical user interface (GUI). When the user interacts with a component that generates action events, the registered ActionListener is notified, and the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method is called. This method contains the code that responds to the user's action.

Here are key points about the ActionListener interface:

1. Interface Definition: The ActionListener interface is part of the java.awt.event package in Java. It defines a single method:
-> void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e);

This method is called when an action event occurs.

2. Event Source: Components that generate action events must implement the ActionListener interface or have a mechanism to register objects that implement this interface.

3. Registration: To handle action events, you need to register an object (often a class that implements ActionListener) with the component that generates the events. This is typically done using the addActionListener(ActionListener listener) method provided by the component.

4. ActionEvent: The ActionEvent class encapsulates information about the event, such as the source of the event and any command string associated with the action. The getSource() method of ActionEvent returns the object that fired the event.
